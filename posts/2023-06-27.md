## A Web Developer's Journey into Unity's Level Design and Worldbuilding

Creating the world of "**Savage Roar**" was like composing an intricate symphony, with each element playing a vital role. My transition from **web design** to Unity's **level design** and worldbuilding unveiled the beauty of __crafting immersive environments__.

### From Pages to Playgrounds: Unity's Scene Management

The concepts of **navigation** and **user flow**, familiar in web design, took on a new dimension in Unity. Creating different scenes and seamlessly transitioning between them was very similar to __navigating__ web pages. Just as I __led users__ through engaging journeys online, I now __guided players__ through immersive **virtual landscapes**, ensuring each level told a __captivating story__.

```c#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string startSceneName = "MainMenu";
    public string gameSceneName = "Gameplay";
    public string gameOverSceneName = "GameOver";

    private void Start()
    {
        // Load the start scene
        LoadScene(startSceneName);
    }

    public void StartGame()
    {
        // Load the gameplay scene
        LoadScene(gameSceneName);
    }

    public void GameOver()
    {
        // Load the game over scene
        LoadScene(gameOverSceneName);
    }

    private void LoadScene(string sceneName)
    {
        // Load the specified scene
        SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
    }
}
```

In this example, the GameManager script manages scene transitions for the "Savage Roar" RPG.

The script uses the SceneManager class to load different scenes, such as the main menu, gameplay, and game over scenes. The StartGame and GameOver methods are called when the game needs to transition to the respective scenes. The LoadScene method encapsulates the process of loading a scene by using its name as an argument.

### Lighting the Way: From Web Ambiance to Game Atmosphere

Web developers understand the power of **lighting** and **ambiance** in creating the right mood. In "**Savage Roar**," I discovered that lighting was my brush, and Unity's lighting tools - __my canvas__. As I sculpted **shadows and illumination**, it was like weaving an atmosphere that transcended the screen, much like crafting a web interface that evokes emotion.
