## A Web Developer's Journey into C# Game Programming

As "**Savage Roar**" evolved, so did my understanding of game programming. From __crafting web interactivity__ to __coding complex C# scripts__, this entry delves into the intricate art of breathing life into the game's **mechanics** and **interactions**.

### Web and Game: Unity's Object-Oriented Paradigm

The transition from the **Document Object Model (DOM)** to Unity's **GameObjects** was a revelation. In Unity, **GameObjects** are the building blocks of interactivity, each akin to a **div element**. As I embraced Unity's **object-oriented paradigm**, I realized that the __principles of structuring and interacting with elements__ were very similar to the web, yet manifested in a **three-dimensional space**.

### AI Unveiled: From Web Interactions to Character Behaviors

While web developers often create basic interactivity with **JavaScript**, __designing AI behavior__ in Unity introduced me to a realm beyond the web. Just as I __crafted interactive elements__ on web pages, I scripted the logic that governed how characters in "**Savage Roar**" behaved. It was a fascinating shift from scripting web interactions to coding the intricate dance of **artificial intelligence**.
